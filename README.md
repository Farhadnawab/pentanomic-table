# PENTANOMIC TABLE

## Client Requirements
```
I need a very simple, 1-page website. It will display the table (attached) using the full browser window.

If I use a mouse or a finger (on a touchscreen PC), I would like the following to happen


If I click/tap a single item, a red circle outline should appear around that item
If I click/tap an item that already has a circle, the circle should disappear
If I click/tap+drag across a row or column, a rounded-red rectangle with yellow background should appear over the items I dragged over. If I drag on a diagonal, the rounded rectangle should include all the rows and columns that form a rectangle across that diagonal
If I click/tap on an item that is already highlighted with a rounded rectangle, the rounded rectangle should disappear.
If I click on the title of the table, all the current highlighting should disappear
```
